# V-Minion WobbleX interfaces



Improvement is in progress but it works pretty well so far.

Additional to the printed parts:

- steel pins 3x10 mm
- 4 mm steel balls
- 3x6 mm neodym magnets
- M3x12 screws and nuts
- M3x10 screws and nuts

I printed everything in PLA with the steel pin side on the bed and 1mm brim. A pause has to be added in the slicer to insert the magnets.

At the V-Minion the lead screw should be aligned well with the coupler first, than replace the coupler with the WobbleX assembly.


## Optimizations

**23.05.2023**

- I had some problems with the heat insert for the lower part now it is clamped with 2 M3x10 screws.
- An upper interface for a SFU1204 Ball Screw was added, see [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/488279-ratrig-v-minion-sfu1204-ball-screw-rod-for-z-axis).
