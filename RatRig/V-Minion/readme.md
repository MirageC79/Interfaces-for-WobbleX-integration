An Idea for the RatRig V-Minion based on the WobbleX concept. 

Improvement is in progress but it works pretty well so far.

Additional to the printed parts:
* 16 pcs. steel pins 3x10 mm
* 4 pcs. 4 mm steel balls
* 8 pcs. 3x6 mm neodym magnets
* 2 pcs. M3x12 screws and nuts
* 2 pc. M3x10 screw

It is not possible to order the WobbleX WS8 at my place,so I designed something similar.
If you have the WobbleX WS8 you need less.

I printed everything in PLA with the steel pin side on the bed and 1mm brim. A pause has to be added in the slicer to insert the magnets.

At the V-Minion the lead screw should be aligned well with the coupler first, than replace the coupler with the WobbleX assembly.

**23.05.2023:**

- I had some problems with the heat insert for the lower part now it is clamped with 2 M3x10 screws. 
- An upper interface for a SFU1204 Ball Screw was added.
