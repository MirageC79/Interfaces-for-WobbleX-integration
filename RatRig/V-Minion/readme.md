An Idea for the RatRig V-Minion based on the WobbleX concept.
Development is in progress but it works pretty well so far.

It is not possible to order the WobbleX WS8 at my place so I designed something similar.

Additional to the printed parts I used:
*16 pcs. steel pins 3x10 mm
*4 pcs. 4 mm steel balls
*8 pcs. 3x6 mm neodym magnets
*2 pcs. M3x12 screws and nuts
*1 pc. M3x6x5 threaded insert
*1 pc. M3x10 screw

If you have the WobbleX WS8 you need less.

I printed everything in PLA with the steel pin side on the bed and 1mm brim.

The lead screw should be aligned well with the coupler first, than replaced by the WobbleX assembly.
