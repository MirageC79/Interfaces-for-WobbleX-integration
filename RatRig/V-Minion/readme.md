An Idea for the RatRig V-Minion based on the WobbleX concept. 

Improvement is in progress but it works pretty well so far.

It is not possible to order the WobbleX WS8 at my place so I designed something similar.

Additional to the printed parts I used:
* 16 pcs. steel pins 3x10 mm
* 4 pcs. 4 mm steel balls
* 8 pcs. 3x6 mm neodym magnets
* 2 pcs. M3x12 screws and nuts
* 1 pc. M3x6x5 threaded insert
* 1 pc. M3x10 screw

If you have the WobbleX WS8 you need less.

I printed everything in PLA with the steel pin side on the bed and 1mm brim. A pause has to be added in the slicer to insert the magnets.

At the V-Minion the lead screw should be aligned well with the coupler first, than replace the coupler with the WobbleX assembly.
