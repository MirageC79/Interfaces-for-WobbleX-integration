# Creality Ender 3

These parts will allow installation of WobbleX Isolators WS8 on Ender 3.  
## WARNING 
* Following user feedback, this system is not recommended for Dual Z cartesian printers.  The WobbleX require a certain amount of weight to keep them together.  A Dual Z installation would divide the XZ gantry weight.
* It is recommended that you use a T-Nut with limited amount of wear to avoid system twisting. Longer T-Nut with more threads is prefered.
* It is recommended that you use use a PTFE based lubricant or other friction reduction lubricants on you leadscrew.  

Notes:
* - I do not own a Creality Ender 3, these parts have not been physically validated.  See the [Feedback](/Creality/Ender3/README.md) section.
* - This mod will require that you relocate the stock Extruder.  Either go Direct Drive or create a bracket that will offset the extruder to make room for the WobbleX
* - Special care might be required to avoid nozzle bumping into blobs.  This might throw gantry up and separate the wobbleX.

## Feedback
I hope you enjoy this modification as much as I do.  As I dont have have an Ender 3 myself, I did not validate this installation physically. 
May you have any issue with the installation please [log an issue.](https://github.com/MirageC79/Interfaces-for-WobbleX-integration/issues)

Happy Printing :smiley:
